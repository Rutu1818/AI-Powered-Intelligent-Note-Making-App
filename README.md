# AI Powered Intelligent Note Making App

Does exactly what it says, the increasing demand for digital learning and remote education has made lecture capturing essential. This project introduces an AI-Powered Intelligent Lecture Note Capture System that leverages speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and AI summarization techniques to convert recorded lectures into well-structured, concise notes. The system enhances accessibility and learning efficiency, especially for students revisiting lectures for revision or clarification.
